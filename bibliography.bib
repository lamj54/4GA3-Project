Design Retrospective analysis of routine epidemiological surveillance data
Setting Line list data on SARS-CoV-2 with specimen receipt dates between 04 March 2020 and 27 November 2021, collected through South Africa’s National Notifiable Medical Conditions Surveillance System
Participants 2,796,982 individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who had a positive test result at least 90 days prior to 27 November 2021. Individuals having sequential positive tests at least 90 days apart were considered to have suspected reinfections.
Main outcome measures Incidence of suspected reinfections through time; comparison of reinfection rates to the expectation under a null model (approach 1); empirical estimates of the time-varying hazards of infection and reinfection throughout the epidemic (approach 2)
Results 35,670 suspected reinfections were identified among 2,796,982 individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who had a positive test result at least 90 days prior to 27 November 2021. The number of reinfections observed through the end of the third wave was consistent with the null model of no change in reinfection risk (approach 1). Although increases in the hazard of primary infection were observed following the introduction of both the Beta and Delta variants, no corresponding increase was observed in the reinfection hazard (approach 2). Contrary to expectation, the estimated hazard ratio for reinfection versus primary infection was lower during waves driven by the Beta and Delta variants than for the first wave (relative hazard ratio for wave 2 versus wave 1: 0.75 (CI95: 0.59–0.97); for wave 3 versus wave 1: 0.71 (CI95: 0.56–0.92)). In contrast, the recent spread of the Omicron variant has been associated with a decrease in the hazard coefficient for primary infection and an increase in reinfection hazard coefficient. The estimated hazard ratio for reinfection versus primary infection for the period from 1 November 2021 to 27 November 2021 versus wave 1 was 2.39 (CI95: 1.88–3.11).
Conclusion Population-level evidence suggests that the Omicron variant is associated with substantial ability to evade immunity from prior infection. In contrast, there is no population-wide epidemiological evidence of immune escape associated with the Beta or Delta variants. This finding has important implications for public health planning, particularly in countries like South Africa with high rates of immunity from prior infection. Urgent questions remain regarding whether Omicron is also able to evade vaccine-induced immunity and the potential implications of reduced immunity to infection on protection against severe disease and death.
Box 1What is already known on this topicWhat is already known on this topicPrior infection with SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to provide at least an 80% reduction in infection risk (1,2).Laboratory-based studies indicate reduced neutralization by convalescent serum for the Beta and Delta variants relative to wild type virus (3–6); however, the impact of these reductions on risk of reinfection is not known, and laboratory assessments of Omicron are still underway.What this study addsWhat this study addsWe provide two methods for monitoring reinfection trends to identify signatures of changes in reinfection risk.We find no evidence of increased reinfection risk associated with circulation of Beta or Delta variants compared to the ancestral strain in routine epidemiological data from South Africa.In contrast, we find clear, population-level evidence to suggest substantial immune evasion by the Omicron variant.
One sentence summary Analysis of routine surveillance data from South Africa suggests that, in contrast to the Beta and Delta, the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates substantial population-level evidence for evasion of immunity from prior infection.}, publisher={medRxiv}, author={Pulliam, Juliet R.

The objective of this study was to review the existing literature on Omicron’s transmissibility, immune evasion, reinfection, and severity.
Method: A literature search was performed in “PubMed”, “Web of Science”, “Scopus”, “ScienceDirect”, “Google Scholar”, “medRxiv”, and “bioRxiv”. Data were extracted from articles that reported at least one of transmissibility, immune evasion, reinfection, and severity related to Omicron. Findings: We found that Omicron spreads faster than any other previous variants. This higher transmissibility can be ascribed to its more extraordinary ability to evade immunity developed by both vaccinations and previous infections. However, we found that infections by Omicron are significantly less severe compared to infections by Delta and other previous variants. We observed a significantly lower incidence of hospitalization, intensive care unit, and mechanical ventilator use, a shorter median hospital stay, and lower fatality rates in Omicron infections than Delta and other variants.
Conclusion: Omicron might be less severe than other VOCs. However, its immune evasiveness and faster spread pose an enormous threat to the global healthcare system.}, institution={In Review}, author={Mohsin, Md and Mahmud, Sultan}, year={2022}, month={Feb}, language={en} }
