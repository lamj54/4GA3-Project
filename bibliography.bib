Design Retrospective analysis of routine epidemiological surveillance data
Setting Line list data on SARS-CoV-2 with specimen receipt dates between 04 March 2020 and 27 November 2021, collected through South Africa’s National Notifiable Medical Conditions Surveillance System
Participants 2,796,982 individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who had a positive test result at least 90 days prior to 27 November 2021. Individuals having sequential positive tests at least 90 days apart were considered to have suspected reinfections.
Main outcome measures Incidence of suspected reinfections through time; comparison of reinfection rates to the expectation under a null model (approach 1); empirical estimates of the time-varying hazards of infection and reinfection throughout the epidemic (approach 2)
Results 35,670 suspected reinfections were identified among 2,796,982 individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who had a positive test result at least 90 days prior to 27 November 2021. The number of reinfections observed through the end of the third wave was consistent with the null model of no change in reinfection risk (approach 1). Although increases in the hazard of primary infection were observed following the introduction of both the Beta and Delta variants, no corresponding increase was observed in the reinfection hazard (approach 2). Contrary to expectation, the estimated hazard ratio for reinfection versus primary infection was lower during waves driven by the Beta and Delta variants than for the first wave (relative hazard ratio for wave 2 versus wave 1: 0.75 (CI95: 0.59–0.97); for wave 3 versus wave 1: 0.71 (CI95: 0.56–0.92)). In contrast, the recent spread of the Omicron variant has been associated with a decrease in the hazard coefficient for primary infection and an increase in reinfection hazard coefficient. The estimated hazard ratio for reinfection versus primary infection for the period from 1 November 2021 to 27 November 2021 versus wave 1 was 2.39 (CI95: 1.88–3.11).
Conclusion Population-level evidence suggests that the Omicron variant is associated with substantial ability to evade immunity from prior infection. In contrast, there is no population-wide epidemiological evidence of immune escape associated with the Beta or Delta variants. This finding has important implications for public health planning, particularly in countries like South Africa with high rates of immunity from prior infection. Urgent questions remain regarding whether Omicron is also able to evade vaccine-induced immunity and the potential implications of reduced immunity to infection on protection against severe disease and death.
Box 1What is already known on this topicWhat is already known on this topicPrior infection with SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to provide at least an 80% reduction in infection risk (1,2).Laboratory-based studies indicate reduced neutralization by convalescent serum for the Beta and Delta variants relative to wild type virus (3–6); however, the impact of these reductions on risk of reinfection is not known, and laboratory assessments of Omicron are still underway.What this study addsWhat this study addsWe provide two methods for monitoring reinfection trends to identify signatures of changes in reinfection risk.We find no evidence of increased reinfection risk associated with circulation of Beta or Delta variants compared to the ancestral strain in routine epidemiological data from South Africa.In contrast, we find clear, population-level evidence to suggest substantial immune evasion by the Omicron variant.
One sentence summary Analysis of routine surveillance data from South Africa suggests that, in contrast to the Beta and Delta, the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates substantial population-level evidence for evasion of immunity from prior infection.}, publisher={medRxiv}, author={Pulliam, Juliet R.

The objective of this study was to review the existing literature on Omicron’s transmissibility, immune evasion, reinfection, and severity.
Method: A literature search was performed in “PubMed”, “Web of Science”, “Scopus”, “ScienceDirect”, “Google Scholar”, “medRxiv”, and “bioRxiv”. Data were extracted from articles that reported at least one of transmissibility, immune evasion, reinfection, and severity related to Omicron. Findings: We found that Omicron spreads faster than any other previous variants. This higher transmissibility can be ascribed to its more extraordinary ability to evade immunity developed by both vaccinations and previous infections. However, we found that infections by Omicron are significantly less severe compared to infections by Delta and other previous variants. We observed a significantly lower incidence of hospitalization, intensive care unit, and mechanical ventilator use, a shorter median hospital stay, and lower fatality rates in Omicron infections than Delta and other variants.
Conclusion: Omicron might be less severe than other VOCs. However, its immune evasiveness and faster spread pose an enormous threat to the global healthcare system.}, institution={In Review}, author={Mohsin, Md and Mahmud, Sultan}, year={2022}, month={Feb}, language={en} }

This ecological study analysed age-standardized incidence rates by economic level in Barcelona.
METHODS: We evaluated confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Barcelona (Spain) between 26 February 2020 and 19 April 2020. Districts were classified according to most recent (2017) mean income data. The reference for estimating age-standardized cumulative incidence rates was the 2018 European population. The association between incidence rate and mean income by district was estimated with the Spearman rho.
RESULTS: The lower the mean income, the higher the COVID-19 incidence (Spearman rho = 0.83; P value = 0.003). Districts with the lowest mean income had the highest incidence of COVID-19 per 10 000 inhabitants; in contrast, those with the highest income had the lowest incidence. Specifically, the district with the lowest income had 2.5 times greater incidence of the disease, compared with the highest-income district [70 (95% confidence interval 66-73) versus 28 (25-31), respectively].

Individuals with a more disadvantaged SEP are more likely to be affected by most of the known risk factors of COVID-19. SEP has been previously established as a potential determinant of infectious diseases in general. We hypothesise that SEP plays an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic either directly or indirectly via occupation, living conditions, health-related behaviours, presence of comorbidities and immune functioning. However, the influence of socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 transmission, severity and outcomes is not yet known and is subject to scrutiny and investigation. Here we briefly review the extent to which SEP has been considered as one of the potential risk factors of COVID-19. From 29 eligible studies that reported the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and their potential risk factors, only one study reported the occupational position of patients with mild or severe disease. This brief overview of the literature highlights that important socioeconomic characteristics are being overlooked when data are collected. As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, it is crucial to collect and report data on socioeconomic determinants as well as race/ethnicity to identify high-risk populations. A systematic recording of socioeconomic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 will be beneficial to identify most vulnerable groups, to identify how SEP relates to COVID-19 and to develop equitable public health prevention measures, guidelines and interventions.}, number={8}, journal={J Epidemiol Community Health}, publisher={BMJ Publishing Group Ltd}, author={Khalatbari-Soltani, Saman and Cumming, Robert C. and Delpierre, Cyrille and Kelly-Irving, Michelle}, year={2020}, month={Aug}, pages={620–623}, language={en} }

Inequities in the burden of COVID-19 were observed early in Canada and around the world, suggesting economically marginalized communities faced disproportionate risks. However, there has been limited systematic assessment of how heterogeneity in risks has evolved in large urban centers over time.
Purpose
To address this gap, we quantified the magnitude of risk heterogeneity in Toronto, Ontario from January to November 2020 using a retrospective, population-based observational study using surveillance data.
Methods
We generated epidemic curves by social determinants of health (SDOH) and crude Lorenz curves by neighbourhoods to visualize inequities in the distribution of COVID-19 and estimated Gini coefficients. We examined the correlation between SDOH using Pearson-correlation coefficients.
Results
Gini coefficient of cumulative cases by population size was 0.41 (95% confidence interval [CI]:0.36–0.47) and estimated for: household income (0.20, 95%CI: 0.14–0.28); visible minority (0.21, 95%CI:0.16–0.28); recent immigration (0.12, 95%CI:0.09–0.16); suitable housing (0.21, 95%CI:0.14–0.30); multigenerational households (0.19, 95%CI:0.15–0.23); and essential workers (0.28, 95%CI:0.23–0.34).
Conclusions
There was rapid epidemiologic transition from higher- to lower-income neighborhoods with Lorenz curve transitioning from below to above the line of equality across SDOH.

However, a number of studies have reported that adolescents are significantly less susceptible than older adults. Summer 2020 provided an opportunity to examine data on prevalence since after months of lockdowns, with the easing of restrictions, people were mingling, leading to surges in cases.
METHODS: We examined data from Departments of Health websites in six U.S. states experiencing surges in cases to determine prevalence of COVID-19, and two prevalence-related measures, in adolescents and youth as compared to older adults. The two other measures related to prevalence were: (Percentage of cases observed in a given age group) ÷ (percentage of cases expected based on population demographics); and percentage deviation, or [(% observed-% expected)/ % expected] x 100.
RESULTS: Prevalence of COVID-19 for adolescents and for youth was significantly greater than for older adults (p < .00001), as was percentage observed ÷ percentage expected (p < .005). The percentage deviation was significantly greater in adolescents/youth than in older adults (p < 0.00001) when there was an excess of observed cases over what was expected, and significantly less when observed cases were fewer than expected (p< 0.00001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results are contrary to previous findings that adolescents are less susceptible than older adults. Possible reasons for the findings are suggested, and we note that public health messaging targeting adolescents and youth might be helpful in curbing the pandemic. Also, the findings of the potential for high transmission among adolescents and youth, should be factored into decisions regarding school reopening.}, number={3}, journal={PloS One}, author={Rumain, Barbara and Schneiderman, Moshe and Geliebter, Allan}, year={2021}, pages={e0242587}, language={eng} }

This study aims to determine whether subway ridership and built environmental factors, such as population density and points of interests, are linked to the per capita COVID-19 infection rate in New York City ZIP codes, after controlling for racial and socioeconomic characteristics.
Methods
Spatial lag models were employed to model the cumulative COVID-19 per capita infection rate in New York City ZIP codes (N=177) as of April 1 and May 25, 2020, accounting for the spatial relationships among observations. Both direct and total effects (through spatial relationships) were reported.
Results
This study distinguished between density and crowding. Crowding (and not density) was associated with the higher infection rate on April 1. Average household size was another significant crowding-related variable in both models. There was no evidence that subway ridership was related to the COVID-19 infection rate. Racial and socioeconomic compositions were among the most significant predictors of spatial variation in COVID-19 per capita infection rates in New York City, even more so than variables such as point-of-interest rates, density, and nursing home bed rates.
Conclusions
Point-of-interest destinations not only could facilitate the spread of virus to other parts of the city (through indirect effects) but also were significantly associated with the higher infection rate in their immediate neighborhoods during the early stages of the pandemic. Policymakers should pay particularly close attention to neighborhoods with a high proportion of crowded households and these destinations during the early stages of pandemics.}, number={5}, journal={American Journal of Preventive Medicine}, author={Hamidi, Shima and Hamidi, Iman}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={614–620}, language={en} }
