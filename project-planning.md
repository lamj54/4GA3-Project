# Variables of Interest
- Time period: December 2021 (when a big wave of COVID occured)
- Main predictor: Income (average of all households in a neighbourhood during the specific time period)
- Extra predictor variables of interest: minorities/ethnicities, household size (can do if we need to)
- Response: COVID cases (rate in each neighbourhood)

# Rough Procedure
1. Focus on December 2021 (peak of COVID cases)

2. Aggregate COVID cases in each neighbourhood in each week of that month

3. Calculate difference in COVID cases between each week-pair (1/2, 2/3, 3/4) and then take the average of them

4. Look at its relationship with proportion of certain household sizes:
-	Don’t need to define what size is ‘large’, etc.—can talk about numbers and maybe identify thresholds ourselves from the results

# Hypothesis
Neighborhoods with larger household sizes are more likely to have a faster rate of change in their COVID cases during infection wave. 

# Data
- Toronto open source COVID Data – period between December 1st - December 31st
- Toronto Neighborhoods data – household sizes 

# Concerns 
- Time-lag of reported COVID cases
- Too little spatial analysis?

# Rubric
This is the rubric for the final report:

10% Introduction – Make sure that there is a clear and concise research question. The introduction is engaging, states the main topic and previews the structure of the paper.

20% Background – Literature review is relevant, up to date, and complete. The background provides a conceptual or theoretical framework to support the analysis in the paper.

20% Data and Methods – The methods are correctly described. Sources of data are properly documented. The format in which the data are used is clearly and precisely described.

20% Analysis – Descriptive statistics of the dataset are present. All parts of the analysis are relevant to the research question, and their use is justified. There is no redundancy in presentation. All methods are correctly applied.

15% Conclusions and Recommendations** – The conclusion speaks directly to the research question, and is supported by the analysis.

10% Presentation – Presentation is professional, with a title page, title, appropriate use of headings and subheadings, and a formatted list of references.

5% Extra mile – Correct application of a method or tool not covered in the course.

The final report in the example by Akhtar, Kalinina, Morrone, Walters, and Wu earned a 91/100. In this report, the students identified an interesting data set (the Washington Post opioids database), learned the tools to work with it, and presented an interesting analysis complemented with data from the census. The project had a clear research question (the potential statistical relationship between opioid prescriptions and various indicators of socio-economic deprivation); various methods from the course were used, the discussion was on point, and the presentation professional. The final grade of the project would have been a 100/100 if the residuals had been analyzed for spatial autocorrelation, and the results of this analysis had been discussed (and any issues had been corrected).
