# Variables of Interest
- Time period: 4 weeks within December 2021; Dec 1-29 (when a big wave of COVID occured)
- Main predictor: Income (per capita average of all households in a neighbourhood during the specific time period)
- Extra predictor variables of interest: minorities/ethnicities, household size (can do if we need to)
- Response: COVID cases (change in rate/proportion in each neighbourhood between weeks)

# Rough Procedure
1. Focus on December 2021 (peak of COVID cases)

2. Aggregate COVID cases in each neighbourhood in each week of that month, divide by population of the neighbourhood and multiply by 1000 (cases per 1000)

3. Aggregate income in each neighbourhood, find the average, and divide by the population to obtain average per capita income

4. Calculate difference in COVID rates between each week-pair (2-1, 3-2, 4-3)

5. Look at each week's (i.e., seperate analyses) change in COVID and its relationship with income

# Hypothesis
Unclear for now. While lower incomes may be more limited in what preventative measures they can take against COVID, higher incomes may travel more and have greater risk of getting COVID.

# Data
- Toronto open source COVID Data – 4 weeks of December (1st to 29th)
- Toronto Neighborhoods data – household sizes, income, etc.

# Concerns 
- Time-lag of reported COVID cases
- Too little spatial analysis?

# Rubric
10% Introduction – Make sure that there is a clear and concise research question. The introduction is engaging, states the main topic and previews the structure of the paper.

20% Background – Literature review is relevant, up to date, and complete. The background provides a conceptual or theoretical framework to support the analysis in the paper.

20% Data and Methods – The methods are correctly described. Sources of data are properly documented. The format in which the data are used is clearly and precisely described.

20% Analysis – Descriptive statistics of the dataset are present. All parts of the analysis are relevant to the research question, and their use is justified. There is no redundancy in presentation. All methods are correctly applied.

15% Conclusions and Recommendations** – The conclusion speaks directly to the research question, and is supported by the analysis.

10% Presentation – Presentation is professional, with a title page, title, appropriate use of headings and subheadings, and a formatted list of references.

5% Extra mile – Correct application of a method or tool not covered in the course.

The final report in the example by Akhtar, Kalinina, Morrone, Walters, and Wu earned a 91/100. In this report, the students identified an interesting data set (the Washington Post opioids database), learned the tools to work with it, and presented an interesting analysis complemented with data from the census. The project had a clear research question (the potential statistical relationship between opioid prescriptions and various indicators of socio-economic deprivation); various methods from the course were used, the discussion was on point, and the presentation professional. The final grade of the project would have been a 100/100 if the residuals had been analyzed for spatial autocorrelation, and the results of this analysis had been discussed (and any issues had been corrected).
