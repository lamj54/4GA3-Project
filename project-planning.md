# Rough Procedure
1. Focus on December 2021 (peak of COVID cases)

2. Aggregate COVID cases in each neighbourhood in each week of that month

3. Calculate difference in COVID cases between each week-pair (1/2, 2/3, 3/4) and then take the average of them

4. Look at its relationship with proportion or average of households:
-	Don’t need to define what size is ‘large’, etc.—can talk about numbers and maybe identify thresholds ourselves from the results

# Hypothesis
Neighborhoods with larger household sizes are more likely to have a faster rate of change in their COVID cases during infection wave. 

# Data
- Toronto open source COVID Data – period between December 1st - December 31st
- Toronto Neighborhoods data – household sizes 

# Concerns 
- Time-lag of reported COVID cases
- Too little spatial analysis?
